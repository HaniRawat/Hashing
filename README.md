# Hashing
Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to hashing. Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It is commonly used in data retrieval, to reduce the time complexity of search operations, and to manage large data efficiently.I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0).
